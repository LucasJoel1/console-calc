<h1 align="center">Console Calc</h1>

Console calculator is a basic graphing calculator written in python3 that uses the textual and rich libraries for making the terminal based ui, however all the functions are written by myself as a way for me to learn how all these mathematical functions are actually calculated (external libraries except for rich and textual are not used whatsoever).  My plan is to have every single function in the popular web based graphing calculator [demos](https://desmos.com/calculator).
